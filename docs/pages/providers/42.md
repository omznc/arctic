# 42 School

For usage, see [OAuth 2.0 provider](/guides/oauth2).

If you haven't done so already, you can create a new application at [42 Applications](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications). Your application will receive an App UID and an App SECRET, both of which need to be provided. You'll also need to configure a `redirectURI` that matches the route in your application.

```ts
import { FortyTwo, FortyTwoTokens } from "arctic";

const ft = new FortyTwo(clientId, clientSecret, redirectURI);
```

```ts
const url: URL = await ft.createAuthorizationURL(state, {
	// optional
	scopes
});
const tokens: FortyTwoTokens = await ft.validateAuthorizationCode(code);
```

## Get user profile

You can retrieve user information via the [`/v2/me` endpoint](https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/me).

```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/me", {
	headers: {
		Authorization: `Bearer ${tokens.accessToken}`
	}
});
const user = await response.json();
```

Refer to the [`/v2/me` documentation](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/2.0/users/me.html) to see which fields are available.
